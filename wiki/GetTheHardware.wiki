#summary Details about what's for sale

*NOTE: Everyone on openrcforums your PCB reservation as already logged as per the role call*

I am only selling PCBs. You will have to source the parts and assemble it yourself. PCB's will be double sided and professionally made. The rest of this wiki contains details to get you on the right track with this.

<b>Q: When will PCBs be available ?</b><br>
<b>A:</b> Second batch of PCBs have just been ordered 2013.Nov.12. So hopefully in about 3 weeks they will be with me.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: How much for a PCB ?</b><br>
<b>A: </b>5.00GBP each.<br>
<br>
<b>Q: How much for postage ?</b><br>
<b>A: </b>All prices are for up to 8 boards:<br>
 * *UK:* Royal mail 1st class post: 1.80GBP
 * *UK:* Royal mail 1st class signed for: 2.90GBP
 * *International:* Royal mail airmail small packet 4.20GBP
 * *International:* Royal mail airmail signed for small packet: 9.50GBP 
The "signed for" services are probably best if you live in an area that has problems with post disappearing.<br>
To keep things simple I have averaged the international costs for various countries in to one price.<br>
Other than adding 1.00GBP for a jiffy bag these are the actual postage prices I will be paying.<br>

<b>A:</b> Once I have received the boards and once I have tested one I will add some Paypal payment buttons here.<br> 
<br>

<br>
<b>Q: Can I get a kit ?</b><br>
