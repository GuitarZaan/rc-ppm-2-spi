=Motivation=

OK, so I don't like more than one transmitter for all my models, and I really don't like the cheap transmitter efforts that a lot of quadcopters are coming with these days. 

=Solution=

With this project I intend to develop a module that will allow you to fly these little quadcopters with a standard modular transmitter. No modifications to the transmitter will be needed, you can plug this project in as any other module and fly your model.

=What models are supported=

Ultimately any model that uses the A7105 transceiver chip. For now only the Hubsan x4 and the [http://www.jperkinsdistribution.co.uk/detail.php?JPNO=6600034&activepage=1&Navmain=Helicopters&subcatname=RTF/RC%20ready%20-%20Twister%20helis JP Twister Quad] are supported. It should be noted the Twister Quad is a clone of the Syma X1 and the WLToys v949 so it is very likely they will work without modification but they need to be tested first.

=What do I need= 

Not much... Details to follow.......
