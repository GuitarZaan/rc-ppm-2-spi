#summary Credits

 * Thanks to PhracturedBlue for the original protocol decodes https://bitbucket.org/PhracturedBlue/deviation/overview and http://www.deviationtx.com/ I personally would love to hear more about your adventures in protocol decoding, I read a snippet from you that hinted toward Arduino and Raspberry pi use, sounded very interesting. EDIT: I got some info from him :) See <a href="http://www.deviationtx.com/forum/protocol-development/2773-teach-us-your-protocol-reversing-tricks-oh-wise-pb#20154">here</a>

 * Thanks to TheObstical over on openrcforums for the original seed that lead to this project, and offering up a lot of the protocol information that convinced me it might not be that big a job after all and for some of the Wiki photos.

 * Thanks to all the guys here http://openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2672 for the support and kind words. I have never really been a forum type but you guys have been awesome, thanks !

 * Thanks to Rick from Leeds for spotting a good few bugs, and generally being an vigilant checker of my code.
