#summary Credits

Thanks to PhracturedBlue for the original protocol decodes https://bitbucket.org/PhracturedBlue/deviation/overview and http://www.deviationtx.com/ 
I personally would love to hear more about your adventures in protocol decoding, I read a snippet from you that hinted toward Arduino and Raspberry pi use, sounded very interesting.

Thanks to TheObstical over on openrcforums for the original seed that lead to this project, and offering up a lot of the protocol information that convinced me it might not be that big a job after all and for some of the Wiki photos.

Thanks to all the guys here http://openrcforums.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=2672 for the support and kind words. I have never really been a forum type but your guys have been awesome, thanks !

Finally thanks to Rick for spotting a potential flaw in the FlySky protocol. (Do you want your full name used so you can have full credits ?)
