#summary Software used for development

The electronics have been designed in KiCAD http://www.kicad-pcb.org/display/KICAD/Download+Kicad <br>
Use this to view the schematic and the PCB design.

The source code was compiled using AVR Studio 4.18 Build 716 http://www.atmel.com/tools/STUDIOARCHIVE.aspx <br> and WinAVR 20100110 http://sourceforge.net/projects/winavr/files/WinAVR/20100110/

To download all the design files and source code you need a SVN client.<br>
 * If you are on Windows download and install TortoiseSVN http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html <br>
 * Then copy this URL to the windows clipboard {{{http://rc-ppm-2-spi.googlecode.com/svn/}}} <br>
